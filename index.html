#### Clash Types

- **Fastest:**
- Solve the problem as quickly as possible. The goal is to be the first to submit a correct solution.

- **Shortest:**
- Write the shortest possible solution that still works correctly. This encourages creative and efficient coding.

- **Reverse:**
- The challenge is to produce a solution that matches a given output, rather than starting from an input. It requires a
different approach to problem-solving.

### Final Ranking Explanation

At the end of the Clash Of Code workshop, the final ranking is determined by the following criteria:

1. **Number of Clashes Completed:**
- In addition to the total points, the participant who completes the most clashes is also considered.
- This means that if two participants have the same total points, the one who finished more clashes will rank higher.

2. **Sum of Rankings:**
- For each clash, participants receive a rank based on their performance:
- 1st place = 1 point
- 2nd place = 2 points
- 3rd place = 3 points
- The total points for each participant are calculated by summing their ranks across all clashes.
